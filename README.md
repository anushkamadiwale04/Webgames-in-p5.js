Game 1 instructions:
	Game 1 is to help the user practice vision and motion coordination. After the game starts, there will be random circles showing up on the screen and you have to tap the circle to gain points. You can click the “End Game” button anytime to end the game. This button will take you to the final thank you screen from where you can choose to play the game again or start a new game. 

Game 2 instructions:
	Game 2 is to help the user practice reaction time and motor function with their fingers from dragging the mouse. To start the game, click the screen and drag the mouse to move the white bar at the bottom of the screen. With the mouse drag the white bar to the white circle that is falling from the top of the screen and catch it. If caught a point will be added to the user score, if missed the game ends with an option to restart the game.

Game 3 instructions:
	Game 3 is to help the user with motor function by practicing washing their hands. To start the game, allow the game to use your computer camera. Now while showing your hands on the screen make circular motions like you are washing your hands. While you are “washing your hands” the pink bubbles on the screen will turn white to simulate being washed. When all the bubbles have turned white the game is complete.
